### Aim: To write the prompts for these following prompt types and evaluate that using any one method 1. Straightforward Prompts, 2. Tabular Format Prompting 3.Preceding Question Prompting and 4. Missing Word Prompting


EXPLANATION

In this experiment, we explore different prompting techniques used in AI-based conversational systems to understand how the structure of a prompt affects the quality, accuracy, and depth of AI responses.

The concept of prompt engineering involves designing and refining prompts to guide an AI model toward producing relevant, coherent, and contextually accurate outputs.

For this experiment, we use a use case from Unit 5 — Environmental Studies: “Understanding Climate Change.”
We apply all four prompt types to this use case and observe how the chatbot (AI model) performs under each technique.

Each type of prompt serves a distinct purpose:

Straightforward prompts: Used for direct factual questions.

Tabular format prompts: Used to present structured or comparative data.

Preceding question prompts: Used to guide multi-step reasoning or explanations.

Missing word prompts: Used for fill-in-the-blank or quiz-based recall.

The experiment also includes an evaluation method to analyze the quality and relevance of responses.


PROCEDURE

1. Straightforward Prompts

Prompts Used:

“Define photosynthesis in one sentence.”

“List three advantages of electric vehicles.”

Chatbot Responses:

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen.

Advantages of electric vehicles:

They reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

They have lower running and maintenance costs.

They produce less noise and air pollution.

Detailed Explanation:
Straightforward prompts give concise and fact-based responses. These are best for quick retrieval of factual information or when clarity and brevity are the main focus.


2. Tabular Format Prompting

Prompts Used:

“Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table.”

“Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each.”

Chatbot Responses:

Detailed Explanation:

Tabular format prompts help the AI organize information visually and logically. They enhance clarity, readability, and allow easy comparison between concepts. This method is particularly effective for educational or analytical reports.



3. Preceding Question Prompting

Prompts Used:

“Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming.”

“How do vaccines work? Describe the process of immunization in simple terms.”

Chatbot Responses:

Climate change is a global concern because it leads to rising sea levels, loss of biodiversity, and extreme weather events. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, creating a ‘greenhouse effect’ that increases global temperatures.

Vaccines work by introducing a harmless form of a pathogen or its genetic material into the body, stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies. This process, known as immunization, helps the body recognize and fight the disease in the future.

Detailed Explanation:
This type of prompting helps in generating context-rich and detailed responses. It is effective for complex reasoning, conceptual explanation, and step-by-step logic where the model connects multiple ideas coherently.



4. Missing Word Prompting

Prompts Used:

“The capital of France is ____.”

“In photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight to produce ____.”

Chatbot Responses:

Paris

Glucose and oxygen

Detailed Explanation:
Missing word prompts are interactive and educational, mainly used for quizzes, practice exercises, or testing recall ability. They test how well the AI can fill contextual blanks accurately.



EVALUATION METHOD USED: QUALITATIVE EVALUATION

Observation:

Straightforward prompts yield precise, short answers.

Tabular prompts improve presentation and structure.
Preceding question prompts create deep, contextual responses.

Missing word prompts are useful for simple, targeted learning activities.



CONCLUSION

The experiment successfully demonstrates how various prompting techniques influence the accuracy, structure, and clarity of AI-generated responses.
Each type of prompt has its specific purpose and advantage:

Straightforward prompts → Quick, factual, and to the point.

Tabular format prompts → Visually structured and easily comparable.

Preceding question prompts → Contextual and reasoning-based.

Missing word prompts → Interactive and useful for testing knowledge.

These findings highlight the importance of prompt design in achieving desired outputs from AI chatbots or large language models.




RESULT

The various types of prompts were executed successfully, and each produced the expected output format.
The results confirm that prompt engineering techniques can be effectively used to generate clear, relevant, and structured AI responses.
Thus, the prompts were executed and evaluated successfully.
